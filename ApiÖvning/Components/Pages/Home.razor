<h1>Welcome to YH's Brogrammer</h1>

<p>Welcome to your new app.</p>

<p>Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!</p>

<p>Here at YH's Brogrammer, we believe in the power of coffee, late-night coding sessions, and the magic of turning caffeine into code. Whether you're debugging at 3 AM or celebrating a successful deployment, remember: there's no place like 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>So, grab your favorite energy drink, put on your favorite coding playlist, and let's turn those semicolons into smiles. Happy coding, bro!</p>
