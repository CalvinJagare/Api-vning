<p class="home-text">Why do programmers prefer dark mode? <span class="home-highlight">Because light attracts bugs!</span></p>

<p class="home-text">Here at YH's Brogrammer, we believe in the power of coffee, late-night coding sessions, and the magic of turning caffeine into code. Whether you're debugging at 3 AM or celebrating a successful deployment, remember: <span class="home-highlight">there's no place like 127.0.0.1.</span></p>

<p class="home-text">So, grab your favorite energy drink, put on your favorite coding playlist, and let's turn those semicolons into smiles. <span class="home-highlight">Happy coding, bro!</span></p>
